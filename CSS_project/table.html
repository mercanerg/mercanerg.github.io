        <p class="resume">
            I am a passionate electronics & Information Technology with 21 years in the technical school. I developed various sort of software for different types of companies, designing web page for school. I developed a device which is recognizing colors and scaling
            distance on the screen, a programmable school bell and an obstacle avoiding robot car by using PIC and ATMEL Microcontrollers. Information technology and electronics appeal to me. I attended many courses on electronics and IT. However, I have
            learned a lot of subjects by studying myself. I am confident with designing for algorithms to solve problems in any software language.
